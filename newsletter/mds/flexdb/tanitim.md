# Indroducting FlexDB

<h2> What is FLexDB? </h2>

FlexDB is for opening JSON based database on your FTP server. For ease of use, you can choose either manual or systematic installation. What should we do to open FlexDB server easily?

+ First we need to download the FlexDB client. This client makes everything as easy as possible :) (You can also install manually if you want)

+ After opening the FlexDB program on your terminal (CMD / GNOME Terminal - XTerm etc.) and completing the necessary steps, your data will be stored on your FTP address at ```/flexdb/<databaseName>/<assets>```

+ You can include your project in your project by downloading the appropriate data extraction module (FlexDB Data Processor) according to the language you have developed (Java, C++, C, Python, Go etc.).

There are many reasons for this, mainly;
	
+ All your data (database password, e-mail, etc. details) are collected on your FTP server. In this way, your safety is in your hands!
