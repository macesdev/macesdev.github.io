# BeMU DevLog #1

Hello again, today we would like to tell you about the developments in the Android version of our BeMU project. Although it is currently closed for use, we would like to indicate our future plans and our course of action.

# Fundamental Change

When we started the project, the first thing we thought was that a lot of people were chatting in the same chat room. Then we thought about the fact that this view can be complicated and we decided to change our chat system.

We consider two types of situations that would be usable. These;

1. General Chat

This type of chat is the way we originally planned it! Lots of chat, separate topic rooms, and fun!

2. Private Messages (DM with your classic exchange)

In this area, you can read messages from your friends. You and no one but Google will not see these messages!

# Friend System

We give nicknames to people we trust in real life, like friends and brothers. So why not a chat app? As we mentioned before, you can talk to your friends as you wish in the Private Chat area!

(This idea is under development. It may change in the final version.)

# Same features, same adventure

In general terms, we felt the need to add a feature like "Cross-Platform". In this way, when you leave the PC, you can immediately read your incoming messages on your phone!

# Technical Changes

Now, Computer and Mobile versions will progress in the same process, so we are trying to get ahead of the complexity. Apart from that, applications for all platforms have been made more reliable and optimized.

# Android Support Coming Soon!

Yes, the Android version of BeMU Chat, which we have been developing for a long time, will be with you very soon!
